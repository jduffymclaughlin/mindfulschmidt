          <h1>about Josh</h1>
          <p>I am a certified meditation and yoga instructor and have experienced the benefits of a dedicated practice. I hope to share these teachings to help bring greater awareness and calm to busy lives. </p>
          <p>My teaching style is influenced by yoga philosophy and focuses on bringing attention into the present moment through bodily sensations. This type of practice allows us to experience a greater awareness of our body and mind, release tension, and promote the development of mindful habits in our daily life.</p>
          <p>These mindfulness-based techniques are simple and effective when practiced consistently over time. Through dedicated practice, we build greater patience and acceptance, which help us to reshape the way we react to everyday stress and frustration. Quite naturally, we become calmer, happier, and more balanced in all aspects of our life.</p>

    <h2>philosophy</h2>
    <p>Acceptance is the root of happiness. If we can look at the situations that are presented to us and truly accept them as they are, we will notice greater happiness, compassion, and love for ourselves and for others.</p>
